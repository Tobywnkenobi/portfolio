            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website</p>
            <p>This is the start of my first webpage. I live in Kents Store of  Charlottesville, Va "Go Hoos!". Over the next ten or 11
                weeks, it will be an intense ride to learn a few foreign languages. Speaking computer.  Terrifing excitement abounds.  
                This website is the start of zero to hero.

            <p class="sec_color_set">
                My journey goes from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Bedford, to the foothills of Danville where I flew
                airplanes.  I got my private, instrument, and commercial certifications.  Then 9/11 happened. This crippled the industry.  Flight cohorts
                were pushed back by months and months.

                I also moonlighted in a restarant. With the industry hurting, I pursued management.  Because of this, I was stuck in the hospitality field for 22 more years or so. Had the
                My new role was as a SAHD for the last few years.  That is the hardest job you will ever do.  I now have this opppourtunity to revisit something that I love,
                while making money at it. I owe it all to the support of my wife. This will be more financially rewarding, and easier!

            <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
            <p>
                At a very young age, I used to enjoy writing out all the DOS lines of code in order to make something simple.  A flower.  A robot.
                I would copy and type these lines on a Tandy Color Computer 3.  Sometimes it would take a couple of days, and it was a long time ago.  This reminds me of those days, where
                I would just lose myself in it.  It also makes me a litte upset that I didn't stick with it.  Neither young me, or my parents, realized how much
                that could have been turned into a career.
